    - the three colormaps are under a CC license from http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/
    - the shapefiles are from https://www.naturalearthdata.com and are in the public domain
    - all WRF data files are created by Fabien Maussion and are in the public domain
    - for some other sample files (e.g. TRMM) I don't know their license, but they are so small and processed that I don't see any big issue in having them here.
